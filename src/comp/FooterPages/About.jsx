            <h1 className="explore-more-categories-padding-bottom-top">About</h1>
            <p className="about-font">Hello, welcome to Tellmeastorymom.com.</p>
            <p className="about-font">I am Sweta, founder of Tellmeastorymom.com.</p>
            <p className="about-font">Currently, I am living in Singapore with my Husband and a cute little daughter.</p>
            <p className="about-font">I am an IT professional and currently working in Singapore. My roots are from a small city in Madhya Pradesh (India).</p>
            <p className="explore-more-categories-padding-bottom-top about-font">Tellmeastorymom.com is my passion. I started it as my hobby in December 2016, but now itâ€™s like my second child.</p>
            <p className="about-font">My daughter is the inspiration behind this site.</p>
            <p className="about-font">Because of her, I realized that stories play an important role in the overall development of a child.</p>
            <p className="about-font">If you have good and meaningful story for a certain topic, then your child will learn that topic very easily.</p>
            <p className="explore-more-categories-padding-bottom-top about-font">But to have stories on your fingertips is also very difficult, because we have lots of other things in our mind, so itâ€™s really difficult to recall all the stories when your little one want you to narrate.</p>
            <p className="about-font">So here I come up with the idea of Tellmeastorymom.com as a solution for all those mothers (fathers too) who struggle to find an apt story for their little one.</p>
            <p className="about-font">Itâ€™s an online platform to share short and sweet stories for kids and teens.</p>
            <p className="explore-more-categories-padding-bottom-top about-font">Here you can get category wise stories. For ex, if you want to narrate stories related to hard work, honesty or any other value, then you can select it as a category and then can narrate stories under that category to your child.</p>
            <p className="about-font">It has stories from various sources like Panchatantra, puran, mythology (like Mahabharata, Ramayana), etc.</p>
            <p className="explore-more-categories-padding-bottom-top about-font">Here you can also share your stories by clicking on the following link :</p>
